what is this in jd?
Converting this table to jd with 
https://onlineconversion.com/julian_date.htm


1 choose vector table. 
2 choose  99942 Apophis (2004 MN4) 2  (type in Apophis)
3 coordinate center type in geocentric
4 time specification  Start=2029-04-13 18:46 TDB , Stop=2029-04-14 00:46, Step=1 (minutes) 
gives a six hour window
5. output:
choose 
 statevector xyz,vxvyvz
 no uncertainties
 reference frame icrf
 reference frame ecliptic xy inertial
   if you choose geocentric equatorial then we would not be able to as easily specify angular momentum axis?
   however if we choose ecliptic, we are going to have trouble specifying earths J2. 
   choosing ecliptic!
 vector correction none=geometric 
 calendar type, I don't think it matters as we also have jd in the time?
 output units km and s
 unclick options below except csv

result is horizons_results_AGeo.csv +- 3 hours from pericenter

data starts after line starting with this:
$$SOE
and line following data has 
$$EOE

For ecliptic 
The x and y axes define a reference plane from which declination or latitude is measured. 
The x-direction defines the origin from which right ascension or longitude is measured.

It is not possible to have outputs at shorter than 1 minute!
