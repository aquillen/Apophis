Apophis Model 1.obj and .ply are from 
https://3d-asteroids.space/asteroids/99942-Apophis  
and they are supposed to be the same model by Pravec+14, 
Units do not seem to be in km. 
This model is convex.
I remove spaces in name of file

apophis_v233s7_vert2_new.mod.wf is an obj file which I received via email from Joe DeMartini
I copied to .obj so that it is clear that it is obj
and is apparently by Brozovic+18.
Note this is not Brozovic+23 though according to Joe, Brozovic+23 and Lee+22
said no changes from Pravic14, and he says Pravic thinks it is not entirely consistent with light curves.
I could not find a paper called Brozovic+23
This shape model contains concave regions!!!!!!!!!
However, rand_bennu( routine should read in vertices and fill in shape model just fine anyways
and that is because it accepts a particle if nearest surface particle has a larger radius. 
So the lack of convexity should not be an issue for my routines.  
This shape model appears to be in km (I am guessing!)
and has 2000 vertices and about twice as many faces. 

format of files, ascii, only vertices needed
lines starting with v are vertices. 
Other lines are ignored in my routines in src_spring.
